The name of the practice is 'Algorithm Practices', which is consisted of subpractices includes 
'Using an algorithm to solve a problem',
'Selecting an appropriate algorithm to solve a problem',
'Assessing the efficiency, correctness, and clarity of an algorithm',
'Modifying an algorithm to better address a problem',
'Designing and constructing algorithms.

Determine whether the following 10 questions reflect the given practice or not (Do not try to answer the questions):

11: Press the "collect sample" button 30 times. Drag the word "Mean" from the table to the horizontal axis of the empty graph. The graph is starting to take shape, but it cannot be called a sampling distribution yet... Why not?
12: A school administrator took a sample of 2 AP statistics students and found their average AP test score to be 1.5. Based on that sample, the Administrator is claiming that the mean test score for all AP stats students at ETHS is 1.5. Do you have substantial evidence to refute their claim? You just created a statistical model - use it to explain to the administrator that their estimate is probably wrong.
13: What was wrong with the administrator's sample?
14: On the left side of the screen you see a table. Click on one of the cells in the row with "index" 17. This should highlight one single dot on the dotplot. Explain what that dot represents in the context of the situation.
15: Suppose an administrator is claiming that the true Mean score of the population is 3.2. Do you have convincing evidence to refute their claim? Explain.
16: First, we'll create the same sampling distribution that we created yesterday. Use the model above to create the sampling distribution for the mean scores of samples of 2 students (n=2) taken from a population of 48 students (N=48).

1) Set the slider and click "setup" and "collect samples." The sampling will happen faster if you pull the "model speed" slider all the way to the right.

2) Click the button that says "tables" in the upper left, then "data set" in order to see your data table. You can drag it around in the CODAP window to wherever you want it.

3) Now we'll set up the graph. First, click the "graph" button in the top left. Then click the "click here" along the x-axis and select "mean."

4) We're also going to find the mean of the data in this graph (That is, the mean of all the means from each sample). To do that click on the ruler to the right of the graph and check "mean." There should now be a line in the middle of your sampling distribution for the mean, and you can hover over it to find out its value.

The mean score for our population of 48 students is 3.4. Is your mean close to that value?
17: Now we're going to do the same thing, except instead of calculating the mean score for our sample, we're going to calculate the MAXIMUM score of our sample. We (Mr. Mickelson and Mr. Mills) made this model, so we can change it in order to explore a different statistic. We're going to change the model to find the maximum of each sample. 

Note: If you need to start fresh just reload the page and everything will reset.

a) Underneath the model window is a tab called "netLogo Code". Click on that to open the code. Don't freak out, we're just going to make one little change!

b) Scroll down to find line 29. You can see the line numbers on the left side of the workspace. 

c) In lines 30 and 31 you should see the word "Mean." In both places, change the word Mean to the word Max.

d) Press recompile code at the top of the workspace.

e) Click setup and collect samples. This time the model will take the maximum value from each sample.

e) Click "tables," the "data set" again. Click "graph" and this time put the "Max" on the axis of the graph.

f) Add the mean to your graph of sample maximums (click the ruler, then check "Mean").

For our population, what is the actual maximum? Is the mean of this sampling distribution close to that value?
18: Now erase that data (either with the trashcan icon under "tables" or refreshing the page) and do the same thing using the minimum statistic (just repeat what you did for Max, just use the word Min). Is the mean of this sampling distribution the same as the actual value of the population minimum?
19: Do you think the mean is a biased estimator? Explain your reasoning.
20: On the next page we'll use the same model but increase the size of our sample (n). What do you think will happen to the sampling distribution? How will that show up in the model?
21: On the next page you'll be asked to use the model to see how sample size affects the variability of the sampling distribution. Make a plan for how you'll use the model to investigate this question.
