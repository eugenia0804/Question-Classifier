Determine whether the following 2 questions reflect the given practice or not (Do not try to answer the questions):

1: What is the parameter of interest? What symbol is used to represent this value?
2: What is the statistic obtained from the sample? What symbol is used to represent this value?
3: How many samples of size 2 can be taken from this population?
                        
 
Return the answer in the a JSON format:
{"Question_number(eg. '1')": {'Question': 'Original text of the question', 'Reasons': 'This question is asking for..., which reflects...', 'Answer': 'Yes/No'}},
                        remember to strickly follow notation rules of json structures
                        (eg. required comma & double quotation mark around property names & use single quotation inside of sentences)"
