The name of the practice is 'Algorithm Practices', which is consisted of subpractices includes 
'Using an algorithm to solve a problem',
'Selecting an appropriate algorithm to solve a problem',
'Assessing the efficiency, correctness, and clarity of an algorithm',
'Modifying an algorithm to better address a problem',
'Designing and constructing algorithms'.

Determine whether the following 9 questions reflect the given practice or not (Do not try to answer the questions):

1: What is the parameter of interest? What symbol is used to represent this value?
2: What is the statistic obtained from the sample? What symbol is used to represent this value?
3: How many samples of size 2 can be taken from this population?
4: What is the parameter of interest for this situation?
5: What statistic are we using to estimate the parameter of interest for this situation?
6: Do you think taking a sample this size from this population effectively estimates the mean score of the population?
7: Calculate the sample mean for all possible samples of size 2 from this population. 
8: Create a dotplot of your results from question #2. Create your sketch below.
9: In most real-life situations, we cannot create the dotplot of all possible samples of size n from the entire population (size N). Why not?
10: Click `setup` and then `collect sample`. What did the model do?
                        
 
Return the answer in the a JSON format:
{"Question_number(eg. '1')": {'Question': 'Original text of the question', 'Reasons': 'This question is asking for..., which reflects...', 'Answer': 'Yes/No'}},
                        remember to strickly follow notation rules of json structures
                        (eg. required comma & double quotation mark around property names & use single quotation inside of sentences)"
