Determine whether the following 2 questions reflect the given practice or not (Do not try to answer the questions):

11: Press the "collect sample" button 30 times. Drag the word "Mean" from the table to the horizontal axis of the empty graph. The graph is starting to take shape, but it cannot be called a sampling distribution yet... Why not?
12: A school administrator took a sample of 2 AP statistics students and found their average AP test score to be 1.5. Based on that sample, the Administrator is claiming that the mean test score for all AP stats students at ETHS is 1.5. Do you have substantial evidence to refute their claim? You just created a statistical model - use it to explain to the administrator that their estimate is probably wrong.
13: What was wrong with the administrator's sample?
