{"21": {"Question": "On the next page you'll be asked to use the model to see how sample size affects the variability of the sampling distribution. Make a plan for how you'll use the model to investigate this question.", "Reasons": "The question is intended for students to perform the work of `Selecting an appropriate algorithm to solve a problem`, which reflects the `Algorithm Practices`.", "Answer": "Yes", "Correct Answer": "No"}, "22": {"Question": "Use your plan and investigate how changing the sample size affects the variability of the sampling distribution (you can show the standard deviation on your graphs in the same way that we showed the mean, go back to page 1 if you need to!). Was your prediction on the previous page correct?", "Reasons": "The focus of the questions is the step to `Assessing the efficiency, correctness, and clarity of an algorithm`, which reflects the `Algorithm Practices`.", "Answer": "Yes", "Correct Answer": "Yes"}}
