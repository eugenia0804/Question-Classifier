The name of the practice is 'Algorithm Practices', which is consisted of subpractices includes 
'Using an algorithm to solve a problem',
'Selecting an appropriate algorithm to solve a problem',
'Assessing the efficiency, correctness, and clarity of an algorithm',
'Modifying an algorithm to better address a problem',
'Designing and constructing algorithms.

Determine whether the following 10 questions reflect the given practice or not (Do not try to answer the questions):

1: What is the parameter of interest? What symbol is used to represent this value?
2: What is the statistic obtained from the sample? What symbol is used to represent this value?
3: How many samples of size 2 can be taken from this population?
4: What is the parameter of interest for this situation?
5: What statistic are we using to estimate the parameter of interest for this situation?
6: Do you think taking a sample this size from this population effectively estimates the mean score of the population?
7: Calculate the sample mean for all possible samples of size 2 from this population. 
8: Create a dotplot of your results from question #2. Create your sketch below.
9: In most real-life situations, we cannot create the dotplot of all possible samples of size n from the entire population (size N). Why not?
10: Click "setup" and then "collect sample". What did the model do?
11: Press the "collect sample" button 30 times. Drag the word "Mean" from the table to the horizontal axis of the empty graph. The graph is starting to take shape, but it cannot be called a sampling distribution yet... Why not?
