2,What is the statistic obtained from the sample? What symbol is used to represent this value?,No,"This question is asking for specific values and symbols, which does not reflect the given practice.",0.0
3,How many samples of size 2 can be taken from this population?,No,"This question is asking for a numerical value, which does not reflect the given practice.",0.0
4,What is the parameter of interest for this situation?,Yes,"This question is asking for the parameter of interest, which reflects the given practice.",0.0
5,What statistic are we using to estimate the parameter of interest for this situation?,Yes,"This question is asking for the statistic used to estimate the parameter of interest, which reflects the given practice.",0.0
6,Do you think taking a sample this size from this population effectively estimates the mean score of the population?,No,"This question is asking for an opinion, which does not reflect the given practice.",0.0
7,Calculate the sample mean for all possible samples of size 2 from this population. ,No,"This question is asking for a numerical calculation, which does not reflect the given practice.",0.0
8,Create a dotplot of your results from question #2. Create your sketch below.,No,"This question is asking for a graphical representation, which does not reflect the given practice.",0.0
9,"In most real-life situations, we cannot create the dotplot of all possible samples of size n from the entire population (size N). Why not?",No,"This question is asking for an explanation, which does not reflect the given practice.",0.0
10,"Click ""setup"" and then ""collect sample"". What did the model do?",Yes,"This question is asking about the action of a computational tool, which reflects the given practice.",0.0
11,"Press the ""collect sample"" button 30 times. Drag the word ""Mean"" from the table to the horizontal axis of the empty graph. The graph is starting to take shape, but it cannot be called a sampling distribution yet... Why not?",No,"This question is asking for an explanation, which does not reflect the given practice.",0.0
12,"A school administrator took a sample of 2 AP statistics students and found their average AP test score to be 1.5. Based on that sample, the Administrator is claiming that the mean test score for all AP stats students at ETHS is 1.5. Do you have substantial evidence to refute their claim? You just created a statistical model - use it to explain to the administrator that their estimate is probably wrong.",Yes,"This question is asking for an explanation of how a statistical model can be used to refute a claim, which reflects the given practice.",0.0

14,"On the left side of the screen you see a table. Click on one of the cells in the row with ""index"" 17. This should highlight one single dot on the dotplot. Explain what that dot represents in the context of the situation.",Yes,"This question is asking for an explanation of what a single dot on a dotplot represents, which reflects the given practice.",0.0
15,Suppose an administrator is claiming that the true Mean score of the population is 3.2. Do you have convincing evidence to refute their claim? Explain.,Yes,"This question is asking for an explanation of how a statistical model can be used to refute a claim, which reflects the given practice.",0.0
