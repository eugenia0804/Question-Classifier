The name of the practice is 'Computational Modeling and Simulation Practices', which is consisted of subpractices includes 
'Using computational models to understand a phenomenon',
'Using computational models to hypothesize and test predictions',
'Using a computational tool to understand a system's compenents and dynamics',
'Using a model to understand how positive and negative feedback function and impact a system',
'Assessing computational models',
'Modifying a computational model to better fit a phenomenon',
'Designing and constructing computational models.
 
Determine whether the following 3 questions reflect the given practice or not (Do not try to answer the questions):

1: What is the parameter of interest? What symbol is used to represent this value?
2: What is the statistic obtained from the sample? What symbol is used to represent this value?
3: How many samples of size 2 can be taken from this population?
 
Return the answer in the following format:
[Question Number]: [Yes or No?] Explanation:[This question is asking for..., which reflect...]
